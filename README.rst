Important Announcement: Griffin is unfunded!
-------------------------------------------

Since mid November/2017, `Anaconda, Inc <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ has
stopped funding Griffin development, after doing it for the past 18
months. Because of that, development will focus from now on maintaining
Griffin 3 at a much slower pace than before.

If you want to contribute to maintain Griffin, please consider donating at

https://opencollective.com/griffin

We appreciate all the help you can provide us and can't thank you enough for
supporting the work of Griffin devs and Griffin development.

If you want to know more about this, please read this
